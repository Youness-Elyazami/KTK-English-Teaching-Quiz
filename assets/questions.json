So, the students all answered 'No, we are not looking at a map of Canada. We are looking at a map of the United States'. Each time the teacher adds other elements to the map, he asks further questions. The teacher invites the students to ask more questions about the map. In the next activity, the teacher asks the students questions which target the use of the prepositions 'next to', 'behind', 'in front of etc.,. Finally, the students are asked to do a gap-filling exercise using the target prepositions.

    "question": "Sophie is a middle school student whose native language is French. In her language, Sophie knows that a sentence such as ' j'ai faim' with the verb 'avoir/to have' is appropriate and grammatically correct. In one of her English (as second language) classes, Sophie wants to say she's hungry and she uses the same construction which she uses in her native language. This resulted in an error in English ' I have hungry'. The teacher indirectly corrected Sophie's mistake and so she internalized the corrected form, which has resulted in changes in her linguistic schema. Using Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which of the following would best describe the mental process which helped Sophie acquire the correct form?",
